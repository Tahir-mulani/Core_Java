## 📖 About

This repository serves as a personal learning journal for Core Java concepts and DSA problems. Each folder contains Java programs that demonstrate various concepts, from basic operators to advanced data structures. I aim to commit code daily to track my progress and build a comprehensive collection of examples.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [1- Operator/](1- Operator/) | Basic operators, arithmetic, logical, and assignment operations |
| [2-Decision Making Statements/](2-Decision Making Statements/) | If-else, switch-case, and conditional logic programs |
| [3-Looping/](3-Looping/) | While, for, and do-while loop implementations |
| [4-Arrays/](4-Arrays/) | Array operations, sorting, searching, and multi-dimensional arrays |
| [5-OOPS/](5-OOPS/) | Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java |
| [6-Collection/](6-Collection/) | Java Collections Framework usage |
| [7-Wrapper Classes/](7-Wrapper Classes/) | Wrapper classes and their applications |
| [DSA/](DSA/) | Data Structures and Algorithms implementations |
| [Revision plan/](Revision plan/) | Revision schedules and plans |

Each folder contains multiple Java files (`.java`) that demonstrate specific concepts or solve particular problems.
